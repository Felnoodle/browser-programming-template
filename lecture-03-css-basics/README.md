# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structures

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- New GitHub repo
- Portfolio page
- This readme

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

Explain at least **three semantic choices** you made in your HTML.

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used:`<figure>`
- Where in the page:Project image
- Why this element is semantically correct:Can add image and a caption for it

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used:`<footer>`
- Where in the page:bottom of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct:footer is typically used for copyright/ownership information

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used:`<ul>`
- Where in the page:hobbies/interests
- Why this element is semantically correct:Automatically adds bullet points for an unnumbered list

*(Example: Why `<section>` instead of `<div>`, why `<article>` here, why this heading level, etc.)*

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- What accessibility features did you include? % of screen width scaling images
- How do they improve usability? Images are somewhat readable both on mobile and desktop

---

## 4. What I learned
- `<ul>` for unnumbered list, `<figure>` for images

## 5. What I still need to improve
- remember to correctly end sections

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: Copilot
- What I accepted as-is: Moving image from under paragraph tag when I asked to improve semantics, added some end of sections I forgot to add
- What I modified manually: Modified %-image scaling the AI suggested (everything else done by me)

# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- CSS for index.html
- Background colors
- More clearly defined categories

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- 'body' element
- '#about' id
- '.navbar' class
- '.project-figure' class
- '.project-figure figcaption' element of a class

## One thing I struggled with
- moving profile image to the left of about me text

## One improvement I want to do next
- Change projects section to allow adding more projects easily
