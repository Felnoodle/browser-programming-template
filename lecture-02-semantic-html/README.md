# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- 
- 
- 

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

Explain at least **three semantic choices** you made in your HTML.

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used:<figure>
- Where in the page:Project image
- Why this element is semantically correct:Can add image and a caption for it

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used:<footer>
- Where in the page:bottom of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct:footer is typically used for copyright/ownership information

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used:<ul>
- Where in the page:hobbies/interests
- Why this element is semantically correct:Automatically adds bullet points for an unnumbered list

*(Example: Why `<section>` instead of `<div>`, why `<article>` here, why this heading level, etc.)*

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- What accessibility features did you include? % of screen width scaling images
- How do they improve usability? Images are somewhat readable both on mobile and desktop

---

## 4. What I learned
- <ul> for unnumbered list, <figure> for images

## 5. What I still need to improve
- remember to correctly end sections

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: Copilot
- What I accepted as-is: Moving image from under paragraph tag when I asked to improve semantics, added some end of sections I forgot to add
- What I modified manually: Modified %-image scaling the AI suggested (everything else done by me)
